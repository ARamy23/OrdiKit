# OrdiKit
OrdiKit is an SDK that aims to automating some tedious tasks by reusing already built solutions for it. 

## The Goal?
OrdiKit is mostly targeted at reusing business codes like Validations, Error Handling, Network and Cache building

Or UI components, whether in UIKit or SwiftUI, whether declarative or imparitive UI, whether using UI by Code or .xibs

Or, wild automations I did over the years for CI/CD, fastlane, or Xcode automations like changing assets folder with set of colors, or installing fonts quickly

## Can I use it?
Sure, this is open-source so feel free to use it however you want.

## Side Notes
This also serve as a playground for testing some ideas or practice over what gets released in Swift over the years
